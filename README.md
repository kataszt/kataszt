## Hiya there I'm Dominik, good to meet you! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my Git!

Here are some Basic informations about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a full-time student, and a part-time Property advisor at a company
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Business Informatics Major on University of Pannonia, im in my second year here, it is quite cool. I'm leaning more into the coding / programming than the business model itself, so it is quite cool in my opinion! 
- The programming languages that I am familiar and know some about is: 
  - Python
  - Basic Webdev langs (HTML, JS, CSS)
  - C# (still learning it, quite hard to learn by myself)
  - I truly like DSA, but I need to sharpen that skill, but I find it interesting
- If you have any tips tricks for me to "Level up" just share your ideas! 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help in mostly all programming languages, I just want to be able to work in this industry for a lifetime

- _So I'm on most socials!_
- âš¡ Fun fact:
     - I truly love learning languages, both programming and basic languages:
         - Hungarian  
         - I was learning english for almost 10 years, and I still use it on a daily basis
         - In elementary I was able to learn Italian for only 2 years, but it was not supported in the school so I had to drop that
         - I liked learning German, but my foundation was not the best so it is on a pretty basic level (Considering how much time I spent on leaning it)
         - I really got hooked onto Japanese, mostly for the culture (like in EVERYTHING) and the flow of that language is justs fascinating itself, so I give in my all to learn it
  
     - I am a gamer myself. I was born and raised in a quite modern family, I was first introduced to 'gaming' by my parents when I was 2 years old! They played Solitaire, and I truly liked it, even though I was pretty much just clicking the large cards from side to side
       Currently I play WoW, and League, but on a casual basis, so I am not a highly competetive player
     - I truly love listening to music, like ask me for a playlist, then I would prolly give you a 200+ songs playlist of that genre
     - with that I am learning to play the guitar, you can never be good enough in that in my opinion

## Thanks for reading all that! Have a wonderful day! ðŸ‘‹
